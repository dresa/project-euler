# project-euler
Project Euler solutions 1--63 by me, written in Clojure. My Project Euler nick is *Eski-or-die*

For computing prime numbers I took Rich Hickey's *sieve* algorithm and fixed it's errors; otherwise I have written the code by myself. If you see some old-fashioned code, it's because I solved most of the problems when Clojure 1.4 was still new. I've moved to 1.7 since, and might continue the work at some point.

*Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.*
