Project Euler solutions 1--63 by me, written in Clojure. My Project Euler nick is *Eski-or-die*

*"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."*, from [Project Euler homepage](https://projecteuler.net/)

From all active Euler users approximately 4% have solved at least 63 problems.

Prime number computations are based on Rich Hickey's *sieve* algorithm (after I fixed it's errors); otherwise I have written the code by myself. If you see some old-fashioned code, it's because I solved most of the problems when Clojure 1.4 was still new. I've moved to 1.7 since, and might continue the work at some point.

I chose Clojure because I wanted practical training with a new language. If I had to solve these problems again in another language, I might also consider Python, R, Matlab/Octave, or Java8. I might even try to learn another new language, like Scala.
